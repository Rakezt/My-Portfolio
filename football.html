        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>&emsp;Like every kids, my favorite game while I was a kid was football (soccer), I love playing this game a
            lot as it involved physically and mentally a lot, I once had a dream that I want to be a footballer when I
            grow up but not sure when does that dream flew away, lol</p>

        <h3> My favourite team "Manchester United"</h3>
        <p>&emsp;Like most of the Indian football , my favourite club was Manchester United, commonly known as Man
            United (often stylised as Man Utd), or simply United. They are a professional football club based in the Old
            Trafford area of Manchester, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top division in the
            English football league system. Nicknamed the Red Devils, it was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club
            in 1878, but changed its name to Manchester United in 1902. The club moved from Newton Heath to its current
            stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.</p>

        <h3>Manchester United achievements</h3>
        <p> &emsp;Manchester United have won a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups, and a record 21 FA
            Community Shields. They have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa
            League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup
            once each. In the 1998–99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English
            football to achieve the European treble of the Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. In winning
            the UEFA Europa League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won the
            original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).</p>

        <h3>My favourite part of Manchester United</h3>
        <p> &emsp;Manchester united are being known in the world for the special player who wore jersey number 7, player
            who wore this jersey are always the special one with unique special abilities. Great's among them include
            George Best, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. All this player were at their prime when
            then wore the jersey and took over at world at their hands</p>

        <p> &emsp; FYI, Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world and has
            rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. It's my favorite club and has be a Red
            Devils Army since I know football. Well, the sad part is now they stand last in the premier league table, do
            you think Manchester United can still finish at top 4??</p>
