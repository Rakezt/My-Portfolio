        <h3> My favourite game "Clash of Clan"</h3>
        <p>&emsp;Like everyone, during my freetime inorder to relive my stress, I like playing mobile games, My favorite
            one is "Clash of Clan". Clash of Clans was developed by Supercell, the company behind other popular mobile
            games like Hay Day. The game took six months to develop with the gameplay changing little over the course of
            development. According to Supercell's Lasse Louhento the development team encountered no major hurdles
            during this time. Inspiration for the game included the games Backyard Monsters and Travian with the art
            style being influenced by old Super NES and arcade games.</p>

        <h3>Clash of Clan Gameplay</h3>
        <p> &emsp;Clash of Clans is an online multiplayer game in which players form communities called clans, train
            troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game. Gold
            and elixir can be used to build and upgrade defenses and traps that protect the player's village from other
            players' attacks and to build and upgrade buildings. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to upgrade troops
            and spells. In past, they were also used to train the troops but now training is free. Gems are the premium
            currency. Attacks are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.</p>

        <h3>My favourite part of Clash of Clan</h3>
        <p> &emsp;The beauty of this game is that their are different troops with different capabilities. You can mix
            and meta and army to bring out the best of your attack. My all time favourite attack strategy is the Golem
            Witch Bowler attack. Unlike any other mobile games, this is not an intense or stress or pressure game,
            instead you can say
            a stress reliver, this game does not need special attention. As the gameplay is for just 3 minutes. You can
            just played for 3 miniutes and keep your mobile back to your pocket and focused back on your work. </p>

        <h3>COC reviews</h3>
        <p> &emsp;FYI, Clash of Clans has received generally positive reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score
            of 74 out of 100 on Metacritic,and 80% on GameRankings. Gamezebo's Leif Johnson was impressed, scoring the
            game 4.5 out of 5. Although he felt the gameplay was heavily skewed to encourage the player to purchase
            gems, he praised the addition of a single-player campaign. He concluded that "Clash of Clans is a simple
            game, but that's more of a strength than a weakness. It's simple enough to provide quick, painless matches
            in an idle moment, and there are enough different units to choose from in the battle mode to make playing
            against other players endlessly rewarding. </p>

        <p>&emsp;So what are you waiting for, Install the game and experience the beauty of it, in your hand.
