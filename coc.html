    <h3 >Myself a bit</h3>
    <p>&emsp;As a kid I love playing videogame during my freetime, fifa was one of the most played games during childhood but eventually as time goes on, everyone seems to moved on even with their game platform as well. Their were playstation, xbox, computer and mobile. Mobile phone become the most common platform for playing game</p>

    <h3> My favourite game "Clash of Clan"</h3>
    <p>&emsp;Like everyone during my freetime inorder to relive my stress, I like playing mobile games, My favorite one is "Clash of Clan". Clash of Clans was developed by Supercell, the company behind other popular mobile games like Hay Day. The game took six months to develop with the gameplay changing little over the course of development. According to Supercell's Lasse Louhento the development team encountered no major hurdles during this time. Inspiration for the game included the games Backyard Monsters and Travian with the art style being influenced by old Super NES and arcade games.</p>

    <h3>Manchester United Gameplay</h3>
    <p> &emsp;Clash of Clans is an online multiplayer game in which players form communities called clans, train troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game. Gold and elixir can be used to build and upgrade defenses and traps that protect the player's village from other players' attacks and to build and upgrade buildings. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to upgrade troops and spells. In past, they were also used to train the troops but now training is free. Gems are the premium currency. Attacks are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.</p>
     
    <h3>My favourite part of Clash of Clan</h3>
    <p> &emsp;Unlike any other mobile games, this is not an intense or stress or pressure game, instead you can say a stress reliver, this game does not need special attention. As the gameplay is for just 3 minutes. You can just played for 3 miniutes and keep your mobile back to your pocket and focused back on your work. </p>

    <p> &emsp; FYI, Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. It's my favorite club and has be a Red Devils Army since I know football. Well, the sad part is now they stand last in the premier league table, do you think Manchester United can still finish at top 4??</p>
